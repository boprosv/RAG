# RAG
AI-Powered Data Science and Machine Learning Knowledge Assistant

In this project, I built a Streamlit application that serves as an AI copilot for Data Science and Machine Learning (ML) tasks. It leverages LangChain, OpenAI's GPT models, and Chroma for vector storage and retrieval. While pre-configured for Data Science and ML tasks, it is highly customizable to tackle a wide range of problems across various domains. Utilizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, this assistant can be tailored to specific industries, use cases, and different databases, making it a powerful tool for AI-driven insights and automation.

To build a knowledge database, I developed an AI-powered application that processes multiple files (including PDFs and other formats), extracts meaningful insights using OpenAI’s embedding model, and stores the data in ChromaDB for fast and intelligent retrieval. I used 10 different books, making this a highly versatile and efficient assistant for creating customized knowledge databases.

Once the "Data_Science.db" were created I used it for AI-Powered Data Science and Machine Learning Knowledge Assistant.

It can be customized.

How Customization Works:

Domain-Specific Knowledge Bases
The assistant can be connected to custom databases or knowledge repositories relevant to your industry or problem domain. For example:

Healthcare: Integrate medical research papers, clinical guidelines, or patient data.

Finance: Connect to financial reports, market analysis, or regulatory documents.

E-commerce: Use product catalogs, customer reviews, or sales data.

Engineering: Incorporate technical manuals, design specifications, or troubleshooting guides.

Tailored Prompts and Responses
The system’s prompts and response templates can be customized to align with your specific needs. For instance:

Adjust the tone (e.g., formal, conversational, technical).

Modify the depth of responses (e.g., concise summaries vs. detailed explanations).

Add domain-specific terminology or jargon.

Integration with Proprietary Data
The assistant can be trained or fine-tuned on your organization’s proprietary data, ensuring that it provides answers and insights that are unique to your business.

Multi-Domain Support
The assistant can handle multiple domains simultaneously. For example, it can switch between providing Data Science advice and offering insights into marketing strategies, all within the same conversation.


In my line of work, this AI-powered application bridges the gap between the business and technical sides, enabling faster problem-solving by providing instant access to relevant insights and data-driven decision-making.
